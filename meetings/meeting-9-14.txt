Began to develop conventions and discussed division of labor. Ideally, we would all like to assist in both parts of the front end and back end. Need to clarify with professor what is expected for the next deliverable. Discussed previous experiences with web design both front and back in. Discussed using jade to develop web page, key feature is readability.
